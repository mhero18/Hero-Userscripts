Just adding here as backup and for reference.
Some of them have small modifications I made.


# [Neopets Search Helper V3](Neopets%20-%20Search%20Helper%20V3.user.js)

Originally created by diceroll123, modified by itemDB, and updates from Hero!

- Added api call to itemDB to retrieve if Wearable
- Added makeApiCall flag to turn on/off (set to true/false)
- DTI icon added for Trading Post and Auctions using above logic
- Added search helper icons underneath Gallery items
- Removed regular Shop Wizard icon because I always use SSW
- Added "sort_by=newest" to TP icon so it opens newest by default
