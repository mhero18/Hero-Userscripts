I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR ANY OF THESE. 
Credit to all the original authors!

Just adding here as backup and for reference.
Some of them have small modifications I made.


# [Neopets Search Helper vHero](Neopets%20-%20Search%20Helper%20vHero.user.js)

Originally created by diceroll123, modified by itemDB, and updates from Hero!

- Added api call to itemDB to retrieve if Wearable
- Added makeApiCall flag to turn on/off (set to true/false)
- DTI icon added for Trading Post and Auctions using above logic
- Added search helper icons underneath Gallery items
- Removed regular Shop Wizard icon because I always use SSW
- Added "sort_by=newest" to TP icon so it opens newest by default



# [Better Quick Stock](Better%20Quick%20Stock.user.js)

Originally created by brunodemarchi, updates from Hero!

- Added toggle to show/hide Discard column
